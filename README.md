# Planets
A small little React application I just wanted to make for fun.

The app interacts with the [Planets API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/planets) from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/) to load info for each planet.

This was also my first time using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which was very fun.
